## HydroBots: Mobile Autonomous Plant Watering Robot
### Overview
HydroBots is a smart, autonomous robot designed to address the challenges of manual plant care. By integrating advanced robotics, sensor technologies, and efficient watering mechanisms, HydroBots aims to optimize water usage and simplify plant maintenance, particularly for indoor environments. The system combines autonomous navigation, collision avoidance, and precise irrigation to deliver a sustainable, user-friendly solution for modern gardening.

### Introduction

Brief context about the increasing demand for sustainable and efficient plant care solutions.
Key problems addressed by HydroBots (e.g., water scarcity, manual labor, inconsistent watering).
Overview of HydroBots' innovative features (e.g., mobile platform, advanced sensors, targeted watering).

### Installation
1. Clone the Repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>/HydroBots_repository.git
    ```
2. Set Up Project Directory:
- Create a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    cd robotics
    ```
   
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv --system-site-packages robotics_env
    ```
    Activate virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source robotics_env/bin/activate
    ```
- Install necessary dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision (not yet complete) get from myboardhub repo
   ```
4. Install Ultralytics
   ```bash
